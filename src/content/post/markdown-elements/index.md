## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(prices)
        l, r = 0, 1
        max_price = 0
        while r < n:
            diff = prices[r] - prices[l]
            if prices[l] > prices[r]:
                l = r
            elif prices[l] < prices[r]:
                max_price = max(max_price, diff)
            r+= 1
        return max_price
```

## References

Second example containing a reference[^2] with a link to the source.

[^1]: Reference first footnote with a return to content link.
[^2]: Second reference with a link.

If you check out this example in `src/content/post/markdown-elements/index.md`, you'll notice that the references and the heading "Footnotes" are added to the bottom of the page via the [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype#options) plugin.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
	return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

### Expressive code examples

Adding a title

```js title="file.js"
console.log("Title example");
```

A bash terminal

```bash
echo "A base terminal example"
```

Highlighting code lines

```js title="line-markers.js" del={2} ins={3-4} {6}
function demo() {
	console.log("this line is marked as deleted");
	// This line and the next one are marked as inserted
	console.log("this is the second inserted line");

	return "this line uses the neutral default marker type";
}
```
